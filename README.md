# Double-Compound-Pendulum

<br>

Implementation of pendulum and double pendulum dynamic using Lagrangian mechanics.

<br>

File Pendulum.ipynb is a python notebook file where you can see pendulum characteristics for 3 different driving forces M=0, M=Ma * cos(&omega; t) and M=Ma * sign(sin(&omega; t)). This file also contains amplitude frequency response characteristics for M=Ma * cos(&omega; t) and M=Ma * sign(sin(&omega; t)).

File Double-Pendulum.ipynb is a python notebook file which contains equations of motion for this double pendulum  as well as &theta;1(t), &theta;2(t), &omega;1(t) and &omega;2(t) for some driving force M(t) acting in the fixed point. Angle  &theta;1 represents the angle between the top rod and the ground while angle &theta;2 represents the angle between the two rods.
